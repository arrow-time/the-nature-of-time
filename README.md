# The Nature Of Time

What is time? How do we understand time? How do we define time? These are frequent questions on Q&A platform, and they are also questions that philosophers, physicists, scholars from interdisciplinary fields, and ordinary people have repeatedly contemplated and pursued. It can be said that understanding time is a fundamental philosophical and physical question.

Throughout history and across cultures, philosophers and physicists have offered various perspectives on the nature of time:

Subjective theory of time: Some philosophers emphasize that time is merely the human consciousness perceiving changes in the external world. From Parmenides, Kant, to Husserl, these thinkers have highlighted the relationship between time and human consciousness.


Objective theory of time: Some philosophers and physicists emphasize that time is a count of motion or change processes.
Time-as-background theory: This view considers time as an independent variable. Some modern physicists hold this view, as did Newton and others in classical physics. In modern quantum field theory, time is similarly treated as a background parameter, although some exploratory branches of quantum field theory consider time as a relational variable within a quantum system.

Time as the process of change in things: This understanding follows the objective theory of time. Modern thinkers such as Leibniz, Whitehead, and contemporary causal set theory all regard time as a collection of events and their relationships.

Spacetime unification: General relativity introduced the concept of spacetime as a unified whole, emphasizing the co-evolution of space and time. General relativity also introduced the idea that the metric field modulates local proper time.

Programming assigns time parameters to events, marking the sequence of events.

Irreversibility of time: Modern thermodynamic studies have revealed that change in real-world phenomena is at least macroscopically irreversible—this is known as the thermodynamic arrow of time or the law of entropy increase. Considering the event-set view of time, the law of entropy increase provides a fundamental driving force behind causal relationships between events.

Locality and non-locality of time and space: Both quantum field theory and general relativity traditionally treat time and space as local, limited by the speed of light, with event relationships following spatial and temporal adjacency. However, some contemporary theories, such as quantum entanglement theory, hypothesize the existence of non-local interactions, supported by a series of experiments.

Now, let's discuss the title of the article: What is the essence of time?

The following are my views:

a. In fact, all theories of time share a common point: time is a measure or count of change—it is a scale or count of change, whether in a continuous or discrete view of change, whether subjective or objective. Subjective time is human perception of change, while objective time is the count of change in the universe as a whole or in its parts.

b. Only a theory of time that incorporates the thermodynamic arrow of time can be considered a good philosophical or physical understanding of time, because the law of entropy increase has been empirically verified, and no counterexamples have been found yet, whether at the microscopic or macroscopic level. Even at the QED level, even a single electron (there is no truly stationary electron) generates entropy through radiation.

c. From the perspective of the rate of change, general relativity and related observational experiments have shown that gravitational fields indeed modulate the frequency of change in local regions—time slows down. That is to say, time is not an independent variable but a relational variable dependent on spatial change. When space is distorted or disturbed by energy, the rate of change in the corresponding local region also changes.

d. The evolution of things and the locality of space and time in their interactions form the foundation of contemporary physics and are also supported by empirical observations. Here, I want to discuss the issue of non-locality: if experiments like those violating Bell's inequality at low energy levels lead to non-local interactions in spacetime, then the laws of physics would not be what we currently observe. Moreover, the object of physical investigation would be an extremely complex system with a state space larger than the computational capacity of the universe itself. From this perspective, non-locality is not valid.

My view: My perspective is close to that of Einstein, Leibniz, Whitehead, and contemporary causal set theory. I believe that time is the count of cosmic change, the refreshment of cosmic states, the set of events, and the set of transformations. In fact, this understanding is easily accepted by professionals in the computer science field. At the same time, time is not an independent variable but is influenced by the change in space itself, as has been verified by observations and experiments, such as gravitational time dilation and gravitational redshift. Furthermore, I believe that space is quantized, and time is the set of spatial transformations. A transformation set of discrete sets is still a discrete set. To fully understand time, we must also distinguish between local time and cosmic global time. The time dilation in special relativity actually reflects different observers in different motion frames counting changes differently, rather than a concept of objective proper time. The gravitational time dilation in general relativity, however, describes how spatial distortion affects the local rate of change.

The following is the outline of my article on the nature of time. By constructing a multiplicative entropy-time-space transformation set with multiple mappings, I attempt to embed the thermodynamic arrow of time—its irreversible nature of energy distribution uniformization—into both general relativity and quantum field theory.
